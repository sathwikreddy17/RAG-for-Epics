{"page": 13, "file": "Ramayana.of.Valmiki.by.Hari.Prasad.Shastri.pdf", "text": "INTRODUCTION \nWBSIBRN culture is cmly just beginning to look beyond the \nRoman and G<eek civilizatious for new inspiration. Even so, \nit is a little surprising that, although the mighty epics of the \nIliad and the Odyssey are widely known and loved, cmly a few \nscholars have studied their Hindu counterparts known as the \nRamaya714 and the Maluzbluutlia. In fact no good complete' \nmodem English translation of the Ramayana exists, and the \nbest of thnse made in the last half of the 19th century are \nunobtainable outside the larger libraries. \nThe Ramayana is a work of great antiquity attributed to the \nillustrious Sage Valmiki. Its date of composition cannot be \nfur:ed with any c:ertainty, particularly as, in common with othet \nSanskrit classics, it was not at first committed to writing, but \nwas passed on from singet to singer. This process also accounts \nfor the fact that the varinus versions (Sakha1) of the poem that \nhave come down to us di1fer slightly in context. The interesting \nfact is that the scholars are agteed that the Ramayana is the \ngrandly conceived and exec:uted mastetpiece of one poet, and \nnot a c:ollection of stories from many sources, loosely gathered \ntogether. \nUnfortunately we know very little about the Rishi Valmiki, \nwhose title 'Adilta¥i' (Firat poet) and pre-eminence in Sanskrit \nverse has never been seriously cbaJlenged to this day. He was \na robber chief in a forest in Northern lndis and on one occasion \nwaylaid two ascetics for the purpose of plundering them. The \ntravellers, however, spoke to him with kindness, and offered \nbim the spiritual truth in lieu of the gold and silver wbich they \ndid nor posseas. Convinced of theit sincerity and on their \nadvice, Valmiki changed bia mode of life and became a devotee \nof Shri Jhrnachandra, tbe Seventh lncamation of God (VIShnu) \n~-n:u~:.~ \n..=':1:L~ =-..:u~.mucb-\n\"\" \n"}

After a long period of meditation on the form and \nvirtues of Shri Rama, it is said that he was granted a vision \nof Rama's life from beginning to end. \nHe gave expression to this unique experience, in Sanskrit verse, \nin the .24,000 sloluu (48,000 lines) known as the Ramayana. \nThe s/oka is a specific metre which the poet himself discovered, \nas is told in a beautifUl passage in the first book. \nThe poem is divided into seven books (Kand<U) of unequal \nlength, which may be very briefiy summarised as follows :-\nBook I. (Bakz-Kmula.) King Dasatatha of Ayodhya (Oudh), \nperforms a sacrifice in the hope of obtaining a son. At this \ntime the Gods (Der1al) are alarmed at the power acquired by \nthe mighty Titan named Ravtna. who, by the practice of black \nmagic had eonquered almost all of the known world. \nKing \nDasaratha's prayer is answered and his three wives bear four \nsons, Rama, Bharata and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna, \nwho are all partial incarnations of Shri Vishnu. Vishnu, \nhowever, manifests himself more fully in Shri Rama than in \nthe other brothers. The boys grow up and Shri Rama wins \nas his bride, Sita, the daughter of King Janaka of the neighbour-\ning kingdom of Videha. \nBook II. \n(Ayadhya-Kanda.) \nKing Dasatatha intends to \nproclaim Shri Rama heir-appsrent, but the jealousy of his second \nqueen, Kaikeyi, is aroused and she holds the king to a promise \nmade formerly, that he would grant her two boons. The boons \nshe now secures are the banishment of Shri Rama to the forest \nfor fourteen years, and the installation of her own son Bharata \nas YUfiiJTaja.' According to the law of righteousness (dharma) \na vow must be honoured, and Shri Rama calmly accepts the \nsentence of exile. He travels south to Chittrakuta in the \nDandaka Forest with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana. \nKing Dasaratba dies of grief and Bharata implores Shri Rama \nto return to the throne, but the latter adheres firmly to \"the \nvindication of his father's honour and the fulfilment of his vow. \nBook III. (AI\"III!)I<Z-Kanda.) After about ten years in the \nforest with her husband, Princeas Sita is kidnapped by the Titan \nRavana, and taken by him to his capital, Lanka (the modern \nCeylon). \n"}

Rama and Lakshmana in \npursuit of Rsvana and to rescue Sita, enlist the aid of King \nSugriva, leader of the monkey tribe, whose chief minister \nHanuman becomes the foremost devotee and servant of Shri \nRsma. \nHelp also comes from Vibishana, brother of Rsvana, \nwho has openly disapproved of the Titan lting's conduct, and \nwarned him of the rerribution he may expect for his unrighteous \nactions. \nBook V. (Sundara-Kanda.) The monkey armies reach the \nsouth coast of India, and, bridging the straits, gain entry into \nLanka. \nBook VI. (Lanka-Kanda.) After a series of pitched battles, \nLanka is captured and Rsvana \\s slain by Shri Rama. \nSita \ndemonstrates her puriry and faithfulness to her husband, by \nsuccessfully undergoing the ordeal by fire. \nThe period of \nfourteen years' exile is by now completed, and Shti Rsma \nreturns with his consort, his brothers and allies, to the capital \nAyodhya, where he begins a long and glorious reign. \nBook VII. (Uttara-Kanda.) This 'later section' or epilogue, \ndescribes the doubts raised in the minds of the citizens \nconcerning the puriry of Sita, and how they compel Shri Rsma \nto send her to Valmiki's hermitage in the forest where she \ngives birth to rwin sons, Kusha and Lava. When these boys \ngrow up, they return to Ayodhya and are recognized by Shri \nRsma, who subsequently brings Sita back to share the ruling \nof the kingdom with him. \nThis in outline is the story of the Rsmayana, which, in the \npoetic grandeur of the original, as well as in the later Hindi \nwork on the same theme by Goswami Tulsidas, has exerted \na tremendous infiuence on the men and women of India. It is \nnot only poetry of unsurpassed dramatic power and brilliance, \nit is a treasure-house of information on rhetoric, medicine, \ngeology, botany, geography and every facet of the ancient \ncivilization, with which learned scholars may interest them-\nselves. For every Hindu, Shri Rsma and Sita are the ideal \nman and woman, the model husband and wife. Shri Rsma \nis an incarnation of God, the One all-pervading Principle of \nTruth and Intelligence, and what higher pattern for one's \nlife could be chosen than this man of perfect virtue, a lover \nxvii \n"}

Truth, \nbenevolence, D;lei:CY and righteousness are the forcea of Light \nwhich are opposed by greed, lust, love of pleasure and power, \nanger and egoity. The real triumph of man means conquest \nof the furces of darkness. In India a festival is celebrated each \nyear on the day traditionally held to be that on which Ravana \nfell and the rule of tyranny, injustice, savagery and unrighteous-\nness ended. \nMention has already been made of Tulsidas' later Hindi epic \non the life of Shri B.ama, which is probably the most widely \nread of all in the present day. One version of the story also \nforms an episode in the Mahabbarata and another comparatively \nmodem treatment of it is the Adbyatma B.smayana ascribed \nto the Sage Vyasa. \nThe Sage Valmiki himself wrote a long metaphysical classic \nknown as the Maharamayana or Yoga Vasishtba, which deals \nwith the inner development of Shri Rama as opposed to his \nouter deeds and which remains one of the most authoritative \nand respected philosophical treatises of Vedanta. \nThe life of Shri B.sma bas entered into the consciousness \nof the Indian people, and much art and literature, such as \nBbababhuti's dramas, draw their inspiration from it. The \nwords of Brahma in the B.smayana bave proved so far to be no \nidle boast : \" So long as mountains and rivers bave place on \nthe earth, the story of the B.smayana will be told in the world.\" \nThe aim of the trsDS!ator is to make the story known to \nEnglish readers in a complete form, the first part of which \nis published in this volume. Although it is not possible to \nreproduce the beauty of the original poetic furm, the true spirit \nof Valmiki's masterpiece is here preserved and for those who \nbave vision, the whole significance of im spiritual purpose will \nbe apparent. \n"}
