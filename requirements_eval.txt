# Evaluation-only dependency set (kept separate from runtime to avoid ML stack conflicts)
#
# Create a separate venv for evaluation:
#   python3 -m venv venv_eval
#   source venv_eval/bin/activate
#   pip install -U pip
#   pip install -r requirements_eval.txt

# Keep numpy compatible with common ML tooling; evaluation does not need the runtime pins.
# If you want maximum safety, you can also pin numpy==1.24.4 here.
numpy>=1.24.0,<1.27.0

# RAGAS and its dependency chain
